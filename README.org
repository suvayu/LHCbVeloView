* Common
All scripts are in the top level directory.

* Python
All python classes and utilities are in ~VeloCronPyTools~.  If you
always call the script with the full path, you can just do =import
VeloCronPyTools.<module>=.  This will not work however when you call
it using a relative path or it is found in your =$PATH=.  Add the
project directory to =$PYTHONPATH= to use them in such scripts.

* Shell scripts
All common functionality is factored out in "libraries" and are
located in ~VeloCronShTools~.  Source and use them.  Similar note as
above applies for paths.

* TODOs
** TODO A =$PYTHONPATH= setup routine

** WInP Run lock class [1/2]
